# IoT-Based Smart City Heatwave & Public Safety Monitoring System
 The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an IoT-based system that monitors environmental conditions—specifically heatwave indicators (temperature and humidity), air quality (gas levels), and worker safety—in urban environments. The system aims to provide real-time alerts, data visualization, and actionable insights to mitigate health risks for workers and the public in smart cities. By integrating multiple sensors and cloud-based platforms, it ensures timely notifications and accessible data for stakeholders.
